# First Use (software)
https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/E-Paper_ESP32_Driver_Board#Demo_Usage
doc: https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/7.5inch_HD_e-Paper_HAT_(B)

* The hardware came with the A/B switch set to B.  Doc says most things (and the 7.5") work on A, so I flipped that
* Connections are all straight-through, everything face up.  
* The example that worked is edp7in5b_V2.ino.  If flashes a bit, and after about 10 seconds, you get the "Waveshare" logo in black, then with red.

## Current status
go and arduino code work. Needs a case to test power/battery longevity.
