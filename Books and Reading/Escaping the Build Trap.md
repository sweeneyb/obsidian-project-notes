# Overview
A book about businesses being outcome driving as opposed to output driven.  How to think about product and service delivery in a way that isn't "feature delivery."
# Notes
* Organizing around components leads to "done" components having large backlogs.  This isn't prioritizing what provides value to the customer.
* Work backward from your value streams.  If you're a component but don't generate value, what's your larger value stream?
* There's an interesting mix of product management work overlapping UX work.  What if your product it headless?
* Product vs service - Products can be reused to deliver value.  Services are value delivered (by people) in a one-off fashion.
