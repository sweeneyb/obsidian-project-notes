# Overview
Short vignettes on how to start and be successful at a coaching business.  There's a lot of exposition on "you ARE worthy" and really focusing on the client.  Be the person they need, and everyone else is too nice to be.  Charge more.
# Notes
* Quickly fire clients that aren't committed
* Intensely focus on the problem and get to the root of their goals. Not just what they say they want.
* Charge. What your doing is of value
  * Specifically, you're not charging for time. You are not charging for what you do. You are charging for what you enable.  The value is saving them time and making their growth happen faster.  Exponential instead of linear.
* Stop taking lunches.  Really, don't support an illusion that what you're doing is friendly. It's business. This isn't a chat with a friend.
* Only take clients you want to coach.
* Chapter 51 argues you should charge because not doing so allows the client to spend money on things that WOULDN'T grow themselves.
* Serve, don't please.  You won't actually serve them or gain their respect. This is the source of a lot of busywork in the world.
* Celebrate billing proposals because they are in your control.  Don't celebrate bills being paid as you can't control who says yes.
* Not having a routine and doing things based on your current emotion (and checking in with yourself throughout the day) is the professionalism of a toddler.  -- I'm not sure I'd be so harsh; capacity is important. But there's some nugget in there about making some things habit and avoid doing nothing because you're not yet in the zone.
