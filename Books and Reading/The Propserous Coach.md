# Overview
Short vignettes on how to start and be successful at a coaching business.  There's a lot of exposition on "you ARE worthy" and really focusing on the client.  Be the person they need, and everyone else is too nice to be.  Charge more.
# Notes
* Quickly fire clients that aren't committed
* Intensely focus on the problem and get to the root of their goals. Not just what they say they want.
* Charge. What your doing is of value
  * Specifically, you're not charging for time.  The value is saving them time and making their growth happen faster.  Exponential instead of linear.
* Only take clients you want to coach.
